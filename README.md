SwiftStandardLibraryPlaygrounds
===============================

A collection of playground demonstrating the use of the Swift Standard Library

The Swift Standard Library is, at the time of writing, rather poorly documented and examples of some of types, functions, enums, structs, protocols, and 
classes (I call these items from now on) are hard to come by. 

This repository is a companion to a set of posts on iosdeveloperzone.com that
attempts to provide a simple explanation of what each item does and a short 
example of its use.

The current playgrounds are:
